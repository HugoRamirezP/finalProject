        <h2>Construction Equipment</h2>
        <p>
            A loader is a heavy equipment machine used in construction to move or load 
            materials such as soil, rock, sand, demolition debris, etc. into or onto 
            another type of machinery (such as a dump truck, conveyor belt, feed-hopper, 
            or railroad car).
            <br>
            <br>
            There are many types of loader, which, depending on design and application, 
            are variously called a bucket loader, end loader, front loader, front-end loader, 
            payloader, high lift, scoop, shovel dozer, skid-steer, skip loader, tractor loader 
            or wheel loader.

        <p>
            Excavators are heavy construction equipment primarily consisting of a boom, 
            dipper (or stick), bucket and cab on a rotating platform known as the "house" - 
            although the largest form ever, the dragline excavator, eliminated the dipper 
            in favor of a line and winch.

        <h2>The Caterpillar D5N Bulldozer</h2>
        <p>
            Over the years, Caterpillar often built different series of D5s at the same time, 
            often with a lighter version having more in common with the smaller D3 and D4 tractors, 
            and a larger version more akin to the much larger D6. Usually, the differentiation had 
            to do with whether the machine incorporated an elevated or high sprocket drive. And later, 
            this also determined the type of transmission used, with the smaller series using a 
            hydrostatic drive and the larger version typically having a Power-Shift transmission.
        </p>
        <h3>Skidsteer</h3>
        <figure>
            <img src="img/skidsteer.jpg" alt="skid-steer">
        </figure>
        <p>
            A skid loader, skid-steer loader, SSL, or skidsteer is any of a class of compact heavy 
            equipment with lift arms that can attach to a wide variety of buckets and other 
            labor-saving tools or attachments.
            <br>
            <br>

The wheels typically have no separate steering mechanism and hold a fixed straight alignment on 
the body of the machine. Turning is accomplished by differential steering, in which the left and 
right wheel pairs are operated at different speeds, and the machine turns by skidding or dragging 
its fixed-orientation wheels across the ground. Skid-steer loaders are capable of zero-radius turning, 
by driving one set of wheels forward while simultaneously driving the opposite set of wheels in reverse.
 This "zero-turn" capability (the machine can turn around within its own length) makes them extremely 
 maneuverable and valuable for applications that require a compact, powerful and agile loader 
 or tool carrier in confined-space work areas.
 <br>
<br>
Like other front loaders, they can push material from one location to another, carry material in the bucket, 
load material into a truck or trailer and perform a variety of digging and grading operations.
